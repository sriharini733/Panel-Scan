# Panel Scan – Solar Panel Degradation Predictor

A modern web application for monitoring and predicting solar panel degradation using image uploads, interactive dashboards, and a beautiful, responsive UI.

---

##  Project Overview

Solar panels are susceptible to microcracks, soiling, and other types of degradation, which reduce their efficiency over time. Manual inspections are slow and expensive. *Panel Scan* provides an intuitive platform for uploading panel images, analyzing their health status, and visualizing trends—empowering proactive maintenance and faster decision-making.

##  Key Features

- *Image Upload & Analysis:*  
  Upload panel images (including drone-captured or thermal images). The application processes these images and delivers instant health assessments and recommendations.

- *Interactive Dashboard:*  
  View real-time results and analytics on a modern dashboard with charts, progress bars, and summary cards.

- *Result Storage:*  
  Analysis results and image data are stored locally in the browser for session continuity and easy reporting.

- *Modern UI/UX:*  
  Clean, responsive, and accessible interface built with React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS.
